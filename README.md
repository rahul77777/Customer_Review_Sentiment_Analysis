This data science project explains how to create **sentiment analysis of customers reviews** using
the **Flipkart Product reviews** dataset from Kaggle.com.

During the model building I have done
#### Data Cleaning
#### Feature Engineering (Removing errors from the data)
    1. Remove Stop Words Remove the stopwords like "a", "the", "I" etc. Remove symbols and special characters.
    2. Remove the special characters from our reviews like '#' ,'&' ,'@' etc.
    3. Tokenize the words. 
    4. We will split the sentences with spaces e.g "I might come" --> "I", "might", "come"
    5. Stemming -Remove the suffixes from the words to get the root form of the word. e.g 'Wording' --> "Word"
#### Perfomerd EDA
    1. Almost 60% of the reviewers have given 5 out of 5 ratings to the products they buy from Flipkart and 80% are Positive reviews

    
    2. I have use a word cloud to visualize the most used words in the reviews column
